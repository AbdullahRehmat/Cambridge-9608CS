## 9.01 Algorithms

- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations



### Structured English

- Provides a more formal way of documenting the stages of the algorithm

  - > PROCESS Check Tire Pressure
    >
    > Start : Job Done = 'No'
    >
    > ​			IF psi <= 30 :
    >
    > ​				Return "Low Pressure"
    >
    > ​				ELSE:
    >
    > ​					Return "Normal Pressure"
    >
    > ​			ENDIF
    >
    > End:
    >
    > ENDPROCESS

  - Labels used : START, END

  - Keywords used : IF, ELSE, ENDIF

  - Whitespace used to improve clarity of steps



### Identifier Names

- > START 
  >
  > END
  >
  > JobDone



### Four Basic Constructs

- **Sequence**
  - High-Level programming languages are designed as a sequence of steps
- **Assignment**
  - Values can be assigned to variables
- **Selection**
  - Algorithm is able to carry out steps for both True and False 
- **Iteration**
  - Occurs when a block of code is repeated
  - Loop structure



### Stepwise Refinement

- The breaking down of a problem into steps



### Program Flowcharts

- Rounded Edge Rectangle
  - START + STOP
- Rectangle
  - Assignment or Action
- Diamond
  - Decision Box
- Lines + Arrows
  - Sequence Direction
- Parallelogram
  - Input + Output



### Input - Output - Processing



### Identifier Tables

| Identifier Name | Description |
| :-------------: | :---------: |
|    Variable     |  Contents   |

## 9.03 Corrective Maintenance

- Name implies that something is wrong
- All code needs to be extensively tested
- Involves
  - Choosing appropriate test data
  - Using a trace table to track how values change as program runs

### Completing A Trace Table

## 9.04 Adaptive Maintenance

- An existing program may have to be adapted of changed
-  Changes to specification requires that the program code is amended and retested
