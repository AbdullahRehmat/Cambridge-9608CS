## 5.01 Operating System

Provides visual user interface which allows user to communicate with computer system



### OS Management Tasks

- Manages:
  - Main Memory
  - Secondary Storage
  - Processor
  - I/O Devices

## 5.02 Utility Programs

### Disk Formatter

- Prepares disk for use with OS's file-system
- Some types of storage come pre-formatted
- Allows disk to be divided into volumes 



### Virus Checker

- Scans system for malware and viruses



### Defragmenter Software

- Reduces amount of fragmentation
- Rearranges data on disk sequentially



### Disk Analysis + Repair Software

- Attempts to retrieve data from damaged Disk



### File Compression

- Processes file so that it takes up less bytes = Compression
- Takes compressed file and recreates original = Decompression



### Backup Software

- One way sync - File Mirroring
- Two way sync - Found in commercial software



## 5.03 Library Programs

### Program Libraries

- Can take form of classes which provides objects to programmer
- Contains features not found by default in the language syntax
- Example: .NET
- Makes Programming easier



### Dynamic Link Libraries

- Is an exe that is only loaded into main memory when required
- Provide mechanism for sharing code and data
- Reduces memory usage over many programs



## 5.04 Language Translators

### Compiler Software

- Translates high-level code into machine code
- Reports Syntax errors to developer
- Final machine code can be run without use of complier



### Interpreter Software

- Can run program from any stage
- Analyses program statement by statement and flags any errors



### Benefits of Compilers

- Creates executable object code
- Executes faster than interpreted programs
- Not needed at run-time
- If program contains loops they are only translated once



### Benefits of Interpreters

- Easier to debug
- Allows for execution from any stage thus saving time
- Allows for testing of non-complete program



### Java

- Platform independent language
- Uses Two-Step compilation process
- Can run on any system without modification
- Allows for Just-In-Time compilation or traditional Ahead-Of-Time compilation
- Byte Code can be interpreted
- Can be directly executed if processor supports it
