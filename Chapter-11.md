## 11.01 Programming Basics

### Identifier Names

- Meaningful variable names make code easier to understand



### Variables & Constants

- Variable is a representation of a data value required by problem
- Memory location used to store data
- Variable name is a label for memory location
- If variable does not change it can be declared as a constant



### Scope of Variables & Constants

- Global Variables can be accessed from any part of program
- Local Variables can only be accessed  inside function that they were created



## 11.02 Transferable Skills

-  IF ELSE CASE Statments
- Loops
- Identifiers: Variables + Constants



## 11.03 Selection

### IF ELSE ENDIF Structure

- > IF <condition>
  >
  > ​     THEN
  >
  > ​         <statements>
  >
  > ​     ELSE
  >
  > ​        <statements>
  >
  > ENDIF

- IF ELSE Statements can be nested



### CASE Structure

- > INPUT <data>
  >
  > CASE
  >
  > ​     <conditions>
  >
  > ​     <conditions>
  >
  > ​     <conditions>
  >
  > ENDCASE



## 11.04 Iteration

### FOR ENDFOR

- Loop stucture used when number of iterations needed is known

- > DECLARE Student : INTEGER
  >
  > FOR Student <- 1 TO 7
  >
  > ​          <statements>
  >
  > ENDFOR



### REPEAT UNTIL

- Used when number of iterations required cannot be predicted

- >REPEAT
  >
  >​          <statements>
  >
  > UNTIL <conditon>



### WHILE ENDWHILE

- Similar to `REPEAT UNTIL` except that condition comes at top of loop

- Known as a precondition loop

- > WHILE <condtitions>
  >
  > ​          <statements>
  >
  > ENDWHILE





### Searching: Linear Search

- Searches through array in order of contents.
- Stops when item is found or end of array reached



### Searching: Bubble Sort

- Compares items in an array
- If first item is larger it is swapped with adjacent item
- This continues until last two items are reached



## 11.05 Built-in Function

### String and Character manipulation functions

- Pseudo Code
- Python



### Functions for Changing Data Types



### ACII Codes



### Technical Documentation



## 11.06 Structured Programming

### Procedures

- Term used when considering a Structure Chart
- A Procedure is a block of code that can be called repeatedly



### Defining and Calling Procedures

- > PROCEDURE <identifier>
  >
  > ​        <statements>
  >
  > END PROCEDURE
  >
  > CALL <identifier>



### Passing Values by Reference or by Value



### User Defined Functions 



### EOF Function

- Identifier Name = EOF
- Parameters = 1 Parameter, File Name
- Returns True of False
